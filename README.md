# Planning-for-Success

## Description

I created this planner as a way for someone to keep track of the to-do items on their work day. The planner will change colors as the day progresses. In this project I was able to learn how to create a loop in jQuery and set/get items into/from Local Storage. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the planner, click and type into the space next to the time to add an item into the planner. As time progresses through the day, the planner colors will change as time progresses. If the box is green that is an event that is in the future. If the box is red, that event is in currently happening. If the box is gray, then the event has passed. 

You can access the planner by going to: https://bbairdgen.github.io/planning-for-success instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

Here is a sample screenshot of what you might see when you visit the planner:
